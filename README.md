# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in JavaScript

Descripton: I am currently studying Python by reading and coding along with [Al Sweigart's book *Automate the Boring Stuff*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).  At the end of Chapter 2, I learned how to code a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  Here, I use what I learned in the lesson to code a similar game in JavaScript.

## My process

I challenged myself to write the code on my own before viewing Sweigart's solution by reviewing what I had learned in chapter 2, and I was almost able to get the game fully running independently!  I just needed to learn how to randomize the computer's turn, so I peeked for that part.  


### Built with

- JavaScript

### What I learned

What was most interesting when I compared the Python version that I had coded on my own to Sweigart's, was my overall approach.  First, I had coded what would fully happen, from the beginning to the end of the round, if the player selected paper, then I repeated for rock, then scissors, and finally quit.  This approach made my code a bit repetitive.  Sweigart's approach was to combine the player selection and to code what would happen in a round in parts.  So, in the first part of the round, the player selects r, p, s, or q.  It made sense to code what happens with q first, so that the program doesn't have to iterate further than that line.  The next part of the round involves displaying to the player what they selected, then what the computer selected.  In the final part of the round, the program compares the computer choice to the player choice, and then records and displays the total wins, losses, and ties.  Sweigart's code was much cleaner and efficient than my code.  His conde took 70 lines compared to mine, which took 74.  His was also much easier to read and follow.
